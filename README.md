# Capstone - Ongling NFL Draft List

NFL fantasy draft list to prepare for draft day!
- Updated 2017 Fantasy stats for QB, TE, WR, RB, K, DST
- Person draft list on login

This site has user authentication and 6 tables with 2017 stats relating to NFL positions for Draft.  Upon login
user will be able to view the list of players base on position and draft them to their personal list.  Each user
can only add the same player once, but this is only on their personal ID.  Other users login will still be able to
add players as long its not same player on their list.  Once you select a player you will be able to update the notes
section in the draft list table to put your notes on the player.

The UI was built using bootstrap and players and draft list are display with the use of handlebars.

# User stories
- User will be able to view 6 tables each related to the player's position
- User will be able to view their Personal Draft list.
- User will be able to add players to their draft list.
- User will be able to remove players from their draft list.
- User will be able to update notes in draft list for each player.
- Users will only the same player once (related to their login only).

# Approach of the Project
- started with users stories
- From there the general layout Wireframe and creation ERD
- Built out the backend API (express/mongo)
- Created a test front-end with buttons to confirm that backend is working
- After confirmation created landing page starting with logins etc

# Reflections and Lessons Learned

-  # Issues
  - Thought installing NPM plugs would of been easy.  The command itself
    was fine but the main problem that trying to get it require was not as simple.
    Had to find the area to require the file was not clear cut answer.  Was able
    resolve the issue by adding the required file on the main index.js
  - Issues with handlebars and attemptoing to add JS scripts to function.  Had to
    run some plugin on success after the handlebars render so that the JS file
    will work.  Learned a fiew ways to get handlebars working with JS by using the
    main class where the handlebars are displaying to get JS to work.

-  # Overall
  - This Captone was the easiest project since I planned better then my other 3.
    I had my backend up frist and made sure that it communicated with my front it
    and tested a deploy on both before I started doing final edits for my front end.
    I feel really good in regareds completing this project and happy with the outcome.



## Dependencies

Install with `npm install`.

-   [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
-   [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
-   [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com)
-   [DataTable.js](https://datatables.net)
    - (DataTable plugin adds search/tables etc for tables with the use of JS)


## Installation

1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.


## Structure

Dependencies are stored in [`package.json`](package.json).

Do not configure `grunt` packages directly in the
[`Gruntfile.js`](Gruntfile.js). Instead, store configurations in the
[`grunt`](grunt) directory. You won't need a top-level key, since that's
generated by the `Gruntfile.js` based on the filename of the configuration
object stored in the `grunt` directory.

Developers should store JavaScript files in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts).
The "manifest" or entry-point is
[`assets/scripts/index.js`](assets/scripts/index.js). In general, only
application initialization goes in this file. It's normal for developers to
start putting all code in this file, but encourage them to break out different
responsibilities and use the `require` syntax put references where they're
needed.

Developers should set `config.apiOrigins.production` (and
`config.apiOrigins.development` if it differs from the default).  With
`apiOrigins` set, developers may rely on `config.apiOrigin` as the base for API
URLs.

Developers should store styles in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and load them
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss).

Developers should use [getFormFields](forms.md) to retrieve form data to send to
an API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA, run `grunt deploy`.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
-   `grunt reformat`: reformats all your code in a standard style
-   `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
-   `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
